    <h3>Beginnings</h3>
    <p>
      Tamiya Ryū (Iaijutsu) has been passed down to the present day through
      various circumstances. Approximately 400 years ago, Hayashizaki Jinsuke
      Shigenobu (? c. 1546-1621), the founder of Shin Musō Hayashizaki Ryū,
      began to pass on his immediate teachings to Tamiya Heibei Shigemasa (Note:
      Depending on the text, the names Narimasa, Narimatsu, Shigetada or
      Shigematsu are used instead of Shigemasa). From among the pupils of
      Hayashizake Jinsuke emerged the founders of Mugai Ryū (Nagano Muraku
      Kinrōsai), Sekiguchi Ryū (Sekiguchi Hachiroemon Jushin) and Hoki Ryu
      (Katayama Hoki no Kami Hisayasu).

      It has been said that Shigemasa, the founder of Tamiya Ryū, was born in
      the Kanto region (Note: On page 83 of Gordon Warner and Don F. Draeger's
      text entitled Japanese Swordsmanship: Technique and Practice, it is stated
      more specifically that he was born in Iwamurata in Jōshū, or Gunma
      Prefecture as it is known today). Shigemasa first took lessons in Musō Ryū
      from Higashi Shimotsuke no Kami, and later pursued a course of study in
      Shin Musō Hayashizaki Ryū under the guidance of Hayashizaki Jinsuke
      himself, adding his own ideas to what he was taught. It is said that he
      then attained the secrets of Shin Musō Hayashizaki Ryū, but with regard to
      his physical appearance there are no details available.

      However, there is an anecdote concerning the word: 長柄刀 (Nagaekatana, or
      Long-hilted Sword) that has been handed down from generation to generation
      to modern times. Shigemasa intentionally wore a sword with a longer hilt,
      explaining that:
      <q>A longer sword is more advantageous</q>. He continued, teaching that
      the strong point of the Nagaekatana lies in the fact that:
      <q>
        One can anticipate a threefold benefit by virtue of having a hilt that
        is 8 Sun (or approximately 9.5 – 10.0 inches)
      </q>". Furthermore, in the section of The Record of Hōjō Sōun entitled The
      Secret Mysteries of Sōhō by Kubota Kiyone, the following explanation of
      this teaching is given:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Given two swords that are the same in length, if the hilt of one is 2 Sun
      (or approximately 2.5 inches) longer there will be, in this case, the
      threefold advantage mentioned previously. First of all, it will be
      difficult for the opponent to reach me but it will be easy for me to reach
      him, resulting in an 8 Sun benefit altogether. Second, if the Nagaekatana
      is held overhead (in Jōdan no Kamae), it will be good for looking down at
      the opponent, while the opponent will have to look up some distance.
      Third, because the opponent must come closer, I have another advantage
      because conversely, I can reach the opponent without a need to come
      closer, so all in all, I have a threefold advantage. This is what is
      called Mikoshi Sanju Ri no Shinmyo Nagae Denju or The Mysterious Teaching
      of the Three Foreseen Advantages of the Long Hilt."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the Schools of Iai that existed during the Sengoku (Civil
      War) Period profited from the use of a long-hilted sword.
