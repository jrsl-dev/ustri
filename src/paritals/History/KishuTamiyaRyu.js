    <h2>Kishu Tamiya Ryu</h2>
    <p>
      Nakamura Zeuemon, who inherited Tamiya Ryū after Tamiya Jirouemon
      Narumichi, changed his full name to Tamiya Chiuemon so that the Tamiya
      family name would not die out. However, the details concerning Chiuemon's
      achievements have not been passed down, and the actual date of his death
      is not certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until Narumichi, the Style that continued to be handed down to the direct
      descendants of the Tamiya line was known as Ko Tamiya Ryū, but after
      Chiuemon it became known as Kishū Tamiya Ryū. In addition (according to
      popular opinion), Wada Hirasuke Seishō of the feudal province of Mito and
      a direct descendant of the Miwa family revived the art of Tamiya Ryū,
      calling it Shin Tamiya Ryū. Furthermore, Hirasuke himself wrote Yo ga
      Ichiban (To Give is Best), which can be found in an article by Yamada
      Jirokichi that was published in Kendō Sōsho (The Kendō Series). Hirasuke
      succeeded in establishing Tamiya Ryū for future generations, like
      Yamashita Yūbei. Collectively, these three lines are called Tamiya San
      Ryū.

      The Style known as Kishū Tamiya Ryū spread to the feudal domain of Iyo
      Saijō (present-day Ehime Prefecture), and achieved great success as Tamiya
      Shinken Ryū (whose curriculum included both Kenjutsu and Iai).

      The sequence of events that led to this development started in the year
      1670 (Kanbun Jūnen) when Yorizumi, the second son of Dainagon Matsudaira
      Yorinobu of the domain of Kii, began to pass on Kishū Tamiya Ryū in Iyo
      Saijō Province, which was a branch of the Kishū family. This was
      accomplished through the efforts of Eda Gizaemon (a follower of Tamiya
      Tsushima no Kami Nagakatsu), who is considered to be the third (Sandai) of
      the Kishū Tamiya Ryū line beginning with the founder, Shigemasa (Shodai),
      followed by his son Nagakatsu (Nidai). By the way, the year 1670 is also
      the year in which Tamiya Heibei Shigemasa died.After that, the Style's
      lineage continued with Miyake Shui; Kurimoto Hanzo; Sanno Bangoro, who was
      called 'The God of War'; Toyota Nakazaemon and Toyota Chikazaemon so that,
      by the middle of the Edo Period, it had taken the world by storm.
