      <h3>Rejuvenation and Renewal</h3>

      <p>
        At various points in all our lives, we experience situations which force
        us, either by choice or necessity, to step back from those activities
        and/or people who are an integral part of our lives. For the better part
        of 5 years, I found myself in such a set of circumstances.
      </p>

        Following my last trip to Japan in 2012 to attend the Kodansha Training
        Seminar with 15th Soke of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa, I
        became occupied with numerous work and family related issues that forced
        me to step back from the second great love of my life, the art of Tamiya
        Ryu Iaijutsu...my wife, Dianne, being the first (of course). Thankfully,
        I was able to lean on an extremely competent and reliable group of
        Instructors, Assistant Instructors and Board of Directors to "take up
        the slack", as it were, and to keep things running efficiently during
        this time.

        United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu (USTRI) has always been a
        "family-centric" organization. Whenever anyone in our group finds
        themselves in a situation where they have to miss a training session, or
        take an extended leave of absence due to family-related matters, we do
        not chide them or make them feel like a lesser person for doing so. In
        point of fact, we chide them if they DON’T take the necessary time to
        attend to whatever family issues they are having, so that they can
        eventually return to their training knowing that they have done all they
        can to resolve their family matters and can approach their training with
        a clear mind and open heart. There are very good reasons for this,
        rooted in my own personal experience.

        In 1994, my late father was diagnosed with severe C.O.P.D. and was given
        about 2 months to live. He was a very proud (and private) man who only
        felt at ease receiving care from licensed caregivers and doctors. At
        that time, I was involved in a sword art (not Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu) whose
        members considered themselves a very tight-knit group and felt that if
        one of their own was in a grave family situation, fellow Dojo members
        should be asked to step in and help. This was not acceptable to both
        myself and my father, so I was, in essence, ostracized from the group
        and all evidence of my presences was expunged from the Dojo.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following my father’s passing in February of 1994, my wife, Dianne, and
        I traveled to Japan to seek rejuvenation and renewal. During that time,
        we had a chance to meet again with Tsumaki Sensei (as he was known to us
        at that time) over lunch at the home of the family who introduced us to
        him the previous year. We explained our situation regarding our former
        Dojo in detail, and with our friends acting as Interpreters (our
        Japanese was not quite as developed as it is now), asked him if it would
        be possible for him to ask his father, the 14 th Soke of Tamiya Ryu
        Iaijutsu, whether he would consider accepting us as Deshi of his Ryuha.
        Upon hearing of our ostracism from our current Dojo, he simple shook his
        head and said that it was very unfortunate and that if we were under his
        tutelage, he would have insisted that we take whatever time we needed
        and return to our training when the family situation was resolved. Prior
        to leaving Japan, we learned from our friends that his father was most
        enthusiastic about having us join the Ryuha and that we should begin our
        new training in earnest. The rest is, as they say, history...
      </p>

        Bringing things back to the present, I swore a solemn oath in 1994 that
        if I ever had the opportunity to create a group in the United States to
        preserve and teach the art of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu, that I would never
        chide or belittle any Deshi who needed to attend to family concerns and
        would follow Tsumaki Sensei’s example of encouragement. So it has been
        for 20 years since USTRI was founded.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, in 2012 I found myself in the position of having to take my own
        words to heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        In February of that year, we willingly and gratefully became caregivers
        for Dianne’s mother, which entailed having her move into our home and
        involved a distinct change of lifestyle. It was at this time that I
        realized it would be necessary to curtail much of my involvement with
        USTRI in order to provide the proper assistance that she needed. In 2015
        her condition worsened and she merged with the great void in July.
        Dianne’s father, who was suffering from cancer due to complications from
        Mesothelioma, passed that same year in October. After the traditional
        Japanese mourning period of 1 year, and following my retirement from my
        job on June 30 of this year, I found that I was now able to rejuvenate
        and renew my involvement with USTRI, all family responsibilities being
        properly fulfilled.
      </p>

      <p>
        I do not mean this essay to be an "apologia" by any means...simply a
        testament to the adage: "Always practice what you preach" and Tsumaki
        Sensei’s example of "making one’s own family a top priority."
      </p>

      <p>
        I would like to conclude these ruminations with one final thought. While
        a certain camaraderie exists within a given Dojo, the leader of that
        group, and its members, should respect a given student’s boundaries and
        encourage them to attend to family matters without fear of ostracism or
        derision upon their return. They should be welcomed back with open arms
        and open hearts as if they never left...
