#### Ko Tamiya Ryu

Tamiya Ryū heir Tsushima no Kami Nagakatsu succeeded Shigemasa, and it is said that their style was first called Tamiya Ryū during this era. From childhood, Nagakatsu received his training from Shigemasa, during which time he was given the childhood nickname Mihira (or Mitsudaira). It has been said that Nagakatsu had a bad habit with respect to his front leg when he would draw his sword during the performance of Iai; a habit that he was unable to correct, despite all of his efforts. So Shigemasa, drawing a fine sword that he had received from the Shōgun, proceeded to prick Nagakatsu's thigh each time he erred, and from that time forward, Nagakatsu's bad habit was corrected.

Concerning Nagakatsu's role at Sekigahara (c. 1600), he served Ikeda Terumasa (in power from 1584 to 1613 – Warner & Draeger, Ibid. p.84) and because of his remarkable service at the Ōsaka winter battle (1614) was praised to Tokugawa Ieyasu. It is also said that he became a vassal of Tokugawa Yorinobu, the master of Hamamatsu Castle and received a stipend of 800 Tepposhū (musketeers), but I do not know if this particular fact is right or wrong. (Note: On page 122 of the text Miyamoto Musashi: His Life & Writings by Tokitsu Kenji, the following is mentioned: "Tamiya Nagakatsu, an Iai Master, received 800 koku from Lord Tokugawa of Hamamatsu Castle. His son, Tamiya Heibei, the founder of Tamiya Ryū Battōjutsu, first received 250 koku and then 800 koku when he succeeded his father.") Later, in 1619 when Yorinobu moved to Kishū (present day Wakayama Prefecture), Nagakatsu followed him, and it was here that Nagakatsu's son, Tamiya Heibei Nagaie, inherited the family estate.

Nagaie (the third successive generation of the line beginning with Tamiya Heibei Shigemasa), together with Kimura Jokurō (a pupil of Yagyū Munenori) and others, offered their respective Styles to Iemitsu, the third Tokugawa Shogun, for formal inspection on March 6 of the year 1651 (Keian Yonnen). In the work by Bōten entitled Daiken Inten Gojikki, there is an entry that is like the one that follows:

> "Kimura Jokurō, a fencer of the feudal domain of Ki, and Iainuki practitioner Tamiya Heibei were summoned to the Imperial residence so that their arts could be inspected. Both men were given appropriate clothing and ten pieces of silver."

This was, to be sure, a great honor for Nagaie, but for the school known as Tamiya Ryū, it can be said that it was an event of great consequence since the entire country came to know that name well.

Tamiya Sannnosuke Asanaru was the fourth of the Tamiya line and successor to Nagaie. However, in the year 1668 (Kanbun Hachinen) Asanaru, on top of having a weak constitution, suffered a series of physical misfortunes and was forced to spend the rest of his life in obscurity. It was then that the fifth heir of the Tamiya line, Tamiya Jirouemon Narumichi succeeded him.

Narumichi not only worked to restore the family's fortunes, but also focused his efforts on guiding the pupils of Tamiya Ryū. Those labors were rewarded as the number of pupils grew and became many. Narumichi rose in prominence and in 1718 (Kyōhō Sannen) created a governing body of 10 persons.

Nevertheless, although the School continued for generations through a direct line of blood relatives, it was its fate to come to an end, as Narumichi was eventually struck down by illness. Both before and after this, Narumichi's legitimate child was not able to inherit the family techniques handed down from father to son, also due to illness. So, in 1734 (Kyōhō Jyūnen) the family estate passed to the eldest son (a grandchild by Narumichi's heir), but he was obliged to turn over the family art of Tamiya Ryū to pupil Nakamura Zeuemon.The fifth generation lasted about 100 years, guarding the lineage. Tamiya Ryū was also handed down during this period, but in an unexpected turn of events, ended up completely losing its legitimacy.
