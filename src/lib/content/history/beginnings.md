#### Beginnings

Tamiya Ryū (Iaijutsu) has been passed down to the present day through various circumstances. Approximately 400 years ago, Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu (? c. 1546-1621), the founder of Shin Musō Hayashizaki Ryū, began to pass on his immediate teachings to Tamiya Heibei Shigemasa (Note: Depending on the text, the names Narimasa, Narimatsu, Shigetada or Shigematsu are used instead of Shigemasa). From among the pupils of Hayashizake Jinsuke emerged the founders of Mugai Ryū (Nagano Muraku Kinrōsai), Sekiguchi Ryū (Sekiguchi Hachiroemon Jushin) and Hoki Ryu (Katayama Hoki no Kami Hisayasu).

It has been said that Shigemasa, the founder of Tamiya Ryū, was born in the Kanto region (Note: On page 83 of Gordon Warner and Don F. Draeger's text entitled Japanese Swordsmanship: Technique and Practice, it is stated more specifically that he was born in Iwamurata in Jōshū, or Gunma Prefecture as it is known today). Shigemasa first took lessons in Musō Ryū from Higashi Shimotsuke no Kami, and later pursued a course of study in Shin Musō Hayashizaki Ryū under the guidance of Hayashizaki Jinsuke himself, adding his own ideas to what he was taught. It is said that he then attained the secrets of Shin Musō Hayashizaki Ryū, but with regard to his physical appearance there are no details available.

However, there is an anecdote concerning the word: 長柄刀 (Nagaekatana, or Long-hilted Sword) that has been handed down from generation to generation to modern times. Shigemasa intentionally wore a sword with a longer hilt, explaining that:A longer sword is more advantageous. He continued, teaching that the strong point of the Nagaekatana lies in the fact that:One can anticipate a threefold benefit by virtue of having a hilt that is 8 Sun (or approximately 9.5 – 10.0 inches)". Furthermore, in the section of The Record of Hōjō Sōun entitled The Secret Mysteries of Sōhō by Kubota Kiyone, the following explanation of this teaching is given:

> "Given two swords that are the same in length, if the hilt of one is 2 Sun (or approximately 2.5 inches) longer there will be, in this case, the threefold advantage mentioned previously. First of all, it will be difficult for the opponent to reach me but it will be easy for me to reach him, resulting in an 8 Sun benefit altogether. Second, if the Nagaekatana is held overhead (in Jōdan no Kamae), it will be good for looking down at the opponent, while the opponent will have to look up some distance. Third, because the opponent must come closer, I have another advantage because conversely, I can reach the opponent without a need to come closer, so all in all, I have a threefold advantage. This is what is called Mikoshi Sanju Ri no Shinmyo Nagae Denju or The Mysterious Teaching of the Three Foreseen Advantages of the Long Hilt."

Nevertheless, the Schools of Iai that existed during the Sengoku (Civil War) Period profited from the use of a long-hilted sword.
