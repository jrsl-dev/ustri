### United State Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu

#### Thunder in Yokohama

The history of the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Organization begins in August of 1993 when Dianne and Michael Alexanian of East Lansing, Michigan made their first trip to Japan as delegates of the Michigan-Shiga Goodwill Mission Cultural Exchange. During that trip, they traveled to Yokohama, Japan and met the Goto family, who were good friends with Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei, the son of the current and 14th Headmaster of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu, Tsumaki Seirin Genshin Soke. At a special training session arranged by Mr. And Mrs. Goto, the Alexanians met Tsumaki Sensei for the first time and had an opportunity to be introduced to the art of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu, as well as demonstrate for Tsumaki Sensei a bit of the sword art they had been studying since 1987 (Toyama Ryu Iaido.) Note: For a more detailed description of this first meeting with Tsumaki Sensei, please refer to the article "Thunder in Yokohama", found in the Articles Section of this website.

In 1994, after the death of Michael's father, the Alexanians returned to Japan to seek inner peace and a new direction for their lives. During that time, with Mrs. Goto acting as their interpreter, they petitioned Tsumaki Sensei to become Deshi (formal students) of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. After consulting with his father, Tsumaki Sensei agreed to accept the Alexanians as the first American Deshi of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu and their training began in earnest.

After two years of diligent training on his own under the guidance of Tsumaki Sensei, Michael Alexanian took his first examination for rank in Japan in the Fall of 1995. It was at that time that Soke Sensei awarded him the combined ranks of Shodan (First Degree) and Nidan (Second Degree). Soke Sensei also took into careful consideration Michael's previous seven years of training in Iaido when making this decision. In the Spring of 1996, after successfully completing the formal examination requirements for the rank of Sandan (Third Degree), Michael Alexanian was given a written commission by Soke Sensei to introduce the art of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu to North America for the first time in the history of the Ryuha (School). In September of 1996, on the occasion of the formal opening ceremonies for the Shakunage Cultural Center and Japanese Gardens, built on the grounds of the Alexanian's home in East Lansing, Michigan, Tsumaki Sensei came to Michigan for the first time to participate in the ceremonies and dedicate the Culture Center as the very first Dojo for Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu in North America.

Since that time, Tsumaki Sensei has traveled to Michigan numerous times to conduct formal training and testing for Deshi of the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Organization and to get to know them better on both a professional and personal level. In July of 1998, both Soke Sensei and Tsumaki Sensei came to Michigan to conduct seminars, formal training and testing for Deshi of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. Quite an accomplishment for Soke Sensei as he was 93 at that time! In 1999, 2002 and 2004, Deshi of the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Organization journeyed to Odawara, Japan to participate in the All-Japan Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Koshukai and Shinsakai (Lecture and Testing Event) held every Spring and Fall.

#### Southeast Michigan Branch Opens

The year 2004 saw the beginning of the expansion of the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu organization with the establishment of its first formal Study Group in Clarkston, Michigan under the leadership of Brent Eastman Sensei (Tamiya Ryu Sandan). Through an arrangement with the Clarkston Parks and Recreation Department, Eastman Sensei was able to arrange for a superb training facility and the opportunity for those in the eastern side of the state to study Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu became possible.

2004 also saw the temporary suspension of all Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Taikai (conventions) and Shinsa (formal testing) due to the advanced age of Soke Sensei, who found that he was no longer able to attend these events due to a decline in his mobility, hearing and eyesight. Group training sessions supervised by Fuku Soke continued in anticipation of the day when the Taikai and Shinsa would resume once again.

In the summer of 2005, Fuku Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei, accompanied by his Assistant, Endo Tsuyako Gentei Sensei, returned once again to East Lansing, Michigan. During this 2005 visit, he conducted various training sessions for USTRI Deshi of all levels, as well as led an Open Seminar for the general public introducing the basic elements of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. On Thursday, July 14, Fuku Soke presided over the 3rd Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Michigan Taikai, conducting group training classes in the morning and supervising the formal testing for rank in the afternoon. Following the formal testing (Shinsa), Fuku Soke issued promotion certificates to those who passed their examinations. This year's group of Shinsa Candidates was the biggest yet, with twenty-four Deshi testing for ranks ranging from Ikkyu through Nanadan.

The next day, the Sensei traveled to Guelph, Ontario, Canada to participate as Instructors at the annual Guelph School of Japanese Sword Arts, held every third weekend of July. The trip to Canada concluded with the Sensei visiting Niagara Falls, accompanied by driver Ken Young (Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Sandan) and Michael Alexanian (Gennan) Shihan.

Also during this visit, the decision was made to upgrade the status of the Clarkston Study Group to that of an official Branch (Shibu), with Brent Eastman Sensei being promoted to Branch Manager (Shibucho). Enrollment in the Clarkston Branch (now known as the Southeast Michigan Branch) continued to increase and a very cohesive group began to develop.

#### Passing of a Generation

In May of 2006 a contingent of 8 USTRI members, along with Alexanian Shihan and Karwowski Sensei, traveled to Japan for the purpose of researching the "roots" of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. They went first to Wakayama City, where the line known as Kishu Tamiya Ryu originated, and had an opportunity to tour Wakayama Castle as well as enjoy a joint training session with the Tamiya Ryu Wakayama Branch. The group then proceeded on to Iyo-Saijo on the island of Shikoku where Matsudaira Yorizumi, the second son of Kishu Dainagon Yorinobu, introduced Tamiya Ryu to the area. Iyo-Saijo is also where the Tsumaki family eventually inherited Tamiya Ryu and where the family cemetery of the Tsumaki family is located. Following a formal demonstration of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu by Alexanian Shihan and Karwowski Sensei at the Saijo Shrine, the entire group made a special stop at the Tsumaki family cemetery to pay their respects and present fresh flowers in memory of the Tsumaki clan. Other places of significance to the history of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu that the group visited were Himeiji Castle, Seki City in Gifu prefecture for a demonstration of traditional Japanese sword-making and various places in the old capital of Kyoto.

When 2007 arrived, significant changes occurred that would impact not only USTRI, but the entire organization as well. At the beginning of June, while in the midst of making plans for the bi-annual visit from Fuku Soke and Endo Sensei, the USTRI Michigan Honbu Dojo received word from Fuku Soke that his father, Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu 14th Soke Tsumaki Seirin, had gone to his eternal sleep at the age of 102 years old. The decision was then made to make the 2007 Tamiya Ryu Michigan Taikai a Memorial Taikai in Soke's honor. The Taikai was a great success and many special activities were conducted in memory of Soke Sensei. There was a silent prayer for Soke Sensei at the beginning of the Taikai, as well as a memorial video presentation showcasing Soke Sensei in his later years. All those in attendance received a copy of the memorial video as a way of having something of Soke Sensei that they could keep with them forever. Another important change during the summer of 2007 was the introduction of the Kenshibu (traditional Japanese dance with sword and fan) component of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu to the USTRI curriculum. During their stay in Michigan, Fuku Soke and Endo Sensei introduced the Kenshibu piece Kawanakajima to the members of USTRI during a special seminar held during the Taikai. Kenshibu has now become an integral part of the USTRI monthly training schedule, with the last class of each month being devoted to becoming more proficient in the movements of this particular piece.On Saturday, September 22, 2007, a meeting was held at the Citizens Hall in Fujisawa City, Japan, to decide the future of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu in the wake of Soke Sensei's passing. It was at that time that Fuku Soke Tsumaki Sensei was unanimously declared as Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu 15th Headmaster (Soshi) and President (Kaicho) of the new organization known as the Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai. With that decided formal Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Taikai and Shinsa resumed in Japan once again on November 23, 2007 under the auspices of the Genwakai.

#### A New Generation

In January of 2008, the Executive Branch of the Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai embarked upon one of its most significant projects to date. Genwakai President Tsumaki Soshi, Vice President Abe, Operations Director Sugizaki and Soshi Assistant Endo began a task which Soshi Sensei describes as follows:

"The Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai has made a plan to standardize the techniques of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu for transmission to future generations."
For six months, this group reviewed notes written by 14th Soke Tsumaki Seirin Genshin and developed a set of standardized procedures for the performance of both Reishiki (Etiquette) and the 11 Kata that comprise the Omote no Maki, or First Volume, of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu techniques and formally introduced them to the Japanese Branches on June 22 of 2008. These Standardized Techniques, or "Touitsu Jikou", were introduced in lecture format to the US Branches at their Closing Class on June 28, 2008 and in full practice format at their Fall All-Member Practice Session on September 6, 2008. Since that time, the members of USTRI have been learning to incorporate these Standardized Techniques into their regular practice of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu under the guidance of their Shidosha, or Instructors.

On November 24, 2008 an 11 member delegation, including Alexanian Shihan, attended their first Genwakai Taikai in Japan. Six USTRI Deshi in the Delegation took their Shinsa (Examinations) in the morning and, at Soshi Sensei's request, the USTRI Delegation performed their Inaugural Enbu (formal demonstration) during the Taikai afternoon program. Following the Taikai there was a social gathering at a traditional Japanese restaurant for all Taikai participants. Prior to attending the Genwakai Taikai, the delegation stayed in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture and spent about 5 days visiting various points of interest such as the Grand Shrine at Ise, Mt. Hiei and Enryakuji Temple, famous castles of Shiga and notable temples of Kyoto, etc. The Delegation returned to the United States on November 26 (Please refer to the Student Views section of this website for some of the trip participant's impressions of their time spent in Japan).

Then, on March 29, 2009, following the Shidosha, Kodansha and Honbucho Lecture in Yokosuka, Japan, a meeting of the Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai Board of Directors (Rijikai) was held. With Vice President Abe acting as the leader, there was a discussion concerning the succession of Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Soshi to 15th Soke of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. With very strong support from the Executives (Kanbu) and Directors (Riji) of the Genwakai, the result after deliberations was that he should indeed succeed to the position of 15th Soke of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu.

Finally, as a result of the recent unfortunate economic downturn that has deeply affected both America and Japan, a joint decision was made in 2009 between 15th Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei and the USTRI Board of Directors that the 2009 visit to Michigan by Soke Sensei and his Assistant, Endo Tsuyako (Gentei) Sensei, as well as the 2010 USTRI trip to Japan should be postponed until the economic climate improves. If all goes well, the regular schedule of exchanges will resume in 2011 when Soke Sensei and Endo Sensei visit Michigan and the USTRI Delegation attends the Genwakai Taikai in Japan in 2012.
