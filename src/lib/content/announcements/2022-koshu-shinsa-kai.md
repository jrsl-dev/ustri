### 2022 United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai Shinsa-Koshukai

The members of the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai gathered on July 16th in East Lansing, Michigan to hold the first annual summer Shinsa-Koshukai in 2 years. Since it has been some time since we were able to meet, nearly every current member of the Gennankai performed for shinsa and because many testing were taking Kodansha, Tsumaki Soke Sensei asked for a copy of the entire performance so he can personally review. Therefore, while it was evident that everyone put in a lot of hard work between May and July and performed their absolute best iai to date, no promotions were announced today. We all await Soke Senseiâ€™s judgement and will regroup in the fall for a proper promotion ceremony. Gennan Buhaku Sensei led a session on Tamiya Ryu Kenshibu Kawanakajima to cap off the afternoon.

To cap off the afternoon, Gennan Buhaku Sensei led the group in Tamiya Ryu Kenshibu Kawanakajimi, explaining the history of the poem and running practice through the first half of the kata. Many Gennankai member enjoy the practice of Kenshibu as a slightly different take on what we normally practice.

Everyone did a wonderful job and I greatly enjoyed several highlight moments during the shinsakai. Great work everybody!
