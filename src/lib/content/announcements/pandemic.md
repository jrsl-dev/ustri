#### USTRI Gennankai Response to the Current Pandemic

Due to these uncertain and challenging times we currently find ourselves in, I would like to take this opportunity to update all of you as to our response to the Corona Virus situation and what lies ahead for our organization.

For the health and safety of all members of the Gennankai, all of our Dojo (Honbu, Southeast Michigan and Brighton) are currently closed until July 1. While our sincere intention is to resume regular Training and Classes in July, it will depend on whether or not the State of Emergency and the Stay at Home Order have been lifted by the Governor. If we are in the clear as of July 1, all our Dojo will re-open and we will be accepting new students once again. New Student Interviews will also resume for those who have completed their Introductory Training. Barring any unforeseen issues, Training will continue as normal for the balance of 2020. Also, our May All-Member Practice and July Shinsakai and Koushuukai (Testing and Lecture) have been cancelled for this year.

Unfortunately, the visit to Michigan this coming July 16-21 by our 15th Soke and his Assistant, Endo Tsuyako ( Gentei) Sensei, has been put on hold until July 15-20 of 2021. Due to the fact that both of them are in a "high-risk" group because of their age and certain health issues, upon close consultation with both of them, we decided that this is the best course of action at this time. Despite the worsening conditions in Japan at this time, Soke Sensei, Endo Sensei and all the members of the Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai are in good health and doing their best to follow the guidelines set forth by the Japanese Government in order to "flatten the curve." The thoughts and prayers of all members of the Gennankai are with our counterparts in Japan and Canada in the hope that all of them come through this Pandemic unaffected!

In closing, my earnest thoughts and prayers for good health and safety are with all of YOU during this unsettled time. Please "stay home, stay safe and save lives" and always remember, "we are all in this together!"

Respectfully submitted,<br />
