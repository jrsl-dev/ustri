<h3 style="text-align: center;">あけましておめでとうございます！<br /> ことしもよろしくおねがいいたします。</h3>

As we mark the end of 2021, a year that saw both change and a return to something like normal for the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai, I’d like to express my gratitude to all the Gennankai members for their commitment and dedication to Tamiya Ryu. Tamiya Ryu is a lineage that has persisted for 400 years. With all the current challenges in the world it would be easy for training to become less than a priority but the Gennankai has held together. It was great to see so many deshi at our Fall All Member Practice, old and new. While practicing Inazuma, I was moved by everyone’s effort to re-dedicate themselves to their practice. Thank you for your perseverance during these interesting times.

Looking forward, 2022 will see the resumption of mostly normal Gennankai’s annual activities. With a few modifications, this will include a Spring and Fall All Member Practice, as well as the Summer Shinsa-Koshukai. Dates and further details will be provided in the future but I’d like to briefly discuss each event this year.
