## TAMIYA RYU IAIJUTSU 15TH SOKE TO VISIT MICHIGAN

<slot />

Members of the Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai are anxiously looking forward to the upcoming visit to Michigan by Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu 15th Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa this September 18-25. It has been 7 years since his last visit and he is very excited to see all the Gennankai members, both old and new, and conduct both Formal Seminars and Private Training sessions. There will be a special Kodansha Seminar for Gennankai members 5th Dan and higher and two All-Member Sessions for all Gennankai members. Soke Sensei will also conduct Private Training Sessions for the Gennankai President and Head Instructor to round out his teaching schedule while he is here. Several Social Gatherings are also planned, including a party for his birthday on September 23!

The Gennankai Board of Directors has been working diligently to make this event as successful as possible and to assure that Soke Sensei has a productive and enjoyable visit this year. All Gennankai members have been practicing intensely to prepare themselves for the upcoming Seminars and constructive input from Soke Sensei (and brushing up on their Japanese language skills as well)!

By the way, if you happen to be a USTRI Alumni and would like further details about Soke Senseiâ€™s schedule, please feel free to email me at the address below.
