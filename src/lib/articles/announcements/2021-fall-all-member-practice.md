### Fall 2021 All Member Practice

The United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai held an All Member practice on Oct. 9th, 2021 at the Hannah Community Center in East Lasing, Michigan. This practice marked a major turning point in USTRI history. The Brighton Study Group was elevated to a Branch dojo and James Russell (Gennetsu) Sensei was promoted to Rokudan (6th Degree) and awarded the title Jokyo (Associate Professor) by the 15th Headmaster, Tsumaki Kazuo (Genwa) Soke Sensei. And after 25 years as Head Instructor for USTRI, Michael Alexanian (Gennan) Sensei, has decided to hand that responsibility over to Russell Gennetsu Sensei. Alexanian Gennan Buhaku Sensei will remain President of the Gennankai and function as Special Lecturer and Emcee at future All Member practices.

Gennan Buhaku Sensei and Gennetsu Sensei have authored a joint article for this month's Message from the Head Instructor.
