#### Tamiya Ryu Today

Tamiya Ryū possesses two scrolls, or volumes of techniques: Omote no Maki, or the First Scroll, contains 11 basic (Kihon) techniques, while Koran no Maki, the Second Scroll, has 14 advanced (Oku Iai) techniques. It should be noted here that, from now on, the name Tamiya Ryū will be used, as Ko Tamiya Ryū came to an end in the modern era, and Tamiya Shinken Ryū is no longer the name of the Style.

The techniques that comprise Omote no Maki are: Inazuma, Oshinuki, Yokemi, Mawari Kakari (standing technique), Mune no Katana, Tsuka Hazushi, Tsuki Tome, Shiranami, Nigemi (standing technique), Oitachi (standing technique), and Chōjō. The techniques that make up Koran no Maki are: Tōgōsetsu, Mizu Kagami, Mojiri Tachi, Satetsu, Utetsu, Fujisan, Matsu Kaze, Yo Arashi (all standing techniques), Intengiri, Yōtengiri, Tsuki Kage no Tachi, Hichō, Myōi, and Murakumo. Each technique performs Jōdan Zanshin. Especially in Jōdan Zanshin, paying attention to the heart (kokoro) is considered to be a "serious custom".

Technique characteristics of the Tamiya Style are that they are done in a large manner and precisely, paying attention to even the smallest of details. Furthermore, one must not forget to include "Nobility" and "Beauty". In this Style, what was termed "Tamiya Nobility" and "Tamiya Beauty" in the Edo Period is regarded to be of the utmost importance, along with the other point mentioned. In written tradition, there is the following statement:

> To begin with, this Style's instruction, using the principle of natural spontaneity, seeks to have proper intuition within and correctness of body without, which leads to the harmony of body and energy.

This harmony is the primary justification for training and allows one to decide the outcome in a matter of minutes by means of drawing one's sword.
