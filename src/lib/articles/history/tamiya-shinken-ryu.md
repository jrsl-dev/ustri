#### Tsumaki Family and Tamiya Shinken Ryu

Then, in 1800 (Kansei Kyūnen) Tsumaki Junjiro Motoaya inherited the Tamiya Style, becoming the eighth (Hachidai) of the line. Since that time the Tsumaki family has protected and passed on Tamiya Ryū as a family art through the transmission of its secret teachings from father to son. Unfortunately, there are no facts regarding how Tsumaki Junjiro Motoaya came to inherit Tamiya Shinken Ryū, but as for the questions concerning 1) why, as Toyota Nakazaemon's leading student, he came to be well known in the Han (Province) and 2) why there was no person in the family of Toyota Chikazaemon who was able to inherit this art, these two guesses might be made.

Tsumaki Junjiro Motoaya was born as the child of Ōkyūtamo Onuemon and later entered the Tsumaki family. He entered government service in 1780 (An'ei Kyūnen), receiving a hereditary stipend of forty koku. A frugal man, he later worked as both a District Magistrate and Construction Magistrate, while it also seems that he undertook a careful study of Uchida Ryū Hōjutsu (Gunnery). On April 24, 1822 (Bunsei Yonnen), Tsumaki Junjiro Motoaya died due to disease and on July 11 of the same year, Tsumaki Nobuhira Motomoro succeeded to the position of 9th Headmaster. Nobuhira was not Junjiro's direct heir, but was the adopted son of another family with the Tsumaki name. In 1821, at the command of the Han, the young Nobuhira was specially chosen to travel to Edo in order to master Confucianism at the Yujima Confucian Temple. Nobuhira inherited Tamiya Shinken Ryū more than one year later and, it appears, was extraordinary with regard to his skills in scholarship and the martial arts. However, in May of 1824 Nobuhira died in Iyo Saijō due to illness.

Nobuhira's successor was his younger sister's husband, Washimi Kenjiro, who later became Tsumaki Heinojo Motoshige when the Tsumaki family adopted Nobuhira's younger sister and took Kenjiro into the Tsumaki family as a son-in-law. The Washimi family served as chief retainers to the Han, achieving importance as a distinguished family and in December of 1834 (Tempō Yonnen), while in Edo, Kenjiro changed his name to Tsumaki Heinojo Motoshige.

There is, at the present time, a letter that was left to the Tsumaki family that was written by Heinojo's father, Washimi Daizen Shinsei, and whose contents are said to include not only admonitions from father to son, but also knowledge of the School. I will try to introduce a part of this letter in the section that follows.

"If you are excessive in scholarship, you will lapse into laziness; if you are excessive in the martial arts, you will become violently strong. When both ways are imperfect, it is also harmful. If a cart lacks one of its wheels, or if a bird loses one of its wings, you cannot be called a true warrior (makoto no bushi). Thinking deeply is essential. You must be careful not to allow your behavior to drift from the path of loyalty and filial piety, even for a moment. It cannot seem as if you are concealing your own illustrious virtue under a cover for the purpose of your own self-interest. Within the heart, safety in study is important. (Section omitted here.) In everything, there are two things: calmness and urgency. When facing calamities, if the heart is not calm, it will become afraid. In a case like that, calm the heart and if you can forgive the reason, be it right or wrong, your troubles will be few."
Heinojo died on August 12, 1863 (Bunkyō Ninen) in Iyo Saijō. His second son, Tsumaki Ataka Motonari (or Gensei), succeeded him after that.

Ataka showed excellent ability in both Spearmanship (Sōjutsu) and Swordsmanship (Kenjutsu), and later became a Gunjikata when mid-ranked and lower-ranked families were summoned in September of the first year of the Meiji Era (1866/1868). Please note that the term Gunjikata (lit. military person) is not used now, but has been replaced by the word Gunjikomon (lit. military adviser). During the Meiji Restoration, Ataka united the views of Iyo Saijō Han without bloodshed, as is stated in The Genealogical History of Iyo (Iyo Shifu).

Iyo Saijō Han was by no means inferior to the other Han with respect to its ardent promotion of the martial arts, and Tamiya Shinken Ryū began to be handed down by means of an unbroken family line. At the beginning of the Taishō Era, a counselor from Saijō by the name of Takahashi Hideomi made the following contribution to The Record of the Saijō Ho'onkai that I would like to mention at this time, expressing what he believed to be the spirit of Saijō. The title of his contribution is: 'Saijō': Its Unique Spirit!

In the Kanbun Era (1661), thirty thousand koku were invested in Saijō. The purpose of this action can be seen in the phrase: "Military power protects the Han, and military power grows by means of an indomitable spirit." The ultimate result of this investiture was that the military arts were encouraged in the Han and, at last, the sentiment of the people turned in favor of military power.

Everyone belonging to the four classes in the Han excelled in the arts of sword, spear and unarmed combat; a custom that has come down to the present day and has not vanished at all. Moreover, it can be said that the deeper and more far-reaching reason for this turn of events was that it became their cultural foundation. For while Saijō Han was considered to be a small fief, as a branch of the Kishū family it took pride in being qualified to follow the Shōgun, and the retainers of Saijō were characterized as being "strong and stubborn in military affairs."

After this, the Tamiya Shinken Ryū lineage continued with Tsumaki Kotaro Motoatsu (or Genkō) (twelfth generation), Tsumaki Yoio Gensei (thirteenth generation) and, in the present age, Tsumaki Seirin Motonobu (or Genshin) (fourteenth generation). In written tradition (Densho) there is a document entitled Kishū Tamiya Ryū: From the Authentic Biography of Tamiya Heibei Shigemasa.

On September 5th, 1988 (Showa 63), the Old Saijo Han Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Preservation Society first announced that Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu would be designated as an Intagible Cultural Asset (Mukei Bunkazai).
