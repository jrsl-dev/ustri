    <h2>Tamiya Ryu Today</h2>
    <p>
      Tamiya Ryū possesses two scrolls, or volumes of techniques: Omote no Maki,
      or the First Scroll, contains 11 basic (Kihon) techniques, while Koran no
      Maki, the Second Scroll, has 14 advanced (Oku Iai) techniques. It should
      be noted here that, from now on, the name Tamiya Ryū will be used, as Ko
      Tamiya Ryū came to an end in the modern era, and Tamiya Shinken Ryū is no
      longer the name of the Style.
    </p>
    <p>
      The techniques that comprise Omote no Maki are: Inazuma, Oshinuki, Yokemi,
      Mawari Kakari (standing technique), Mune no Katana, Tsuka Hazushi, Tsuki
      Tome, Shiranami, Nigemi (standing technique), Oitachi (standing
      technique), and Chōjō. The techniques that make up Koran no Maki are:
      Tōgōsetsu, Mizu Kagami, Mojiri Tachi, Satetsu, Utetsu, Fujisan, Matsu
      Kaze, Yo Arashi (all standing techniques), Intengiri, Yōtengiri, Tsuki
      Kage no Tachi, Hichō, Myōi, and Murakumo. Each technique performs Jōdan
      Zanshin. Especially in Jōdan Zanshin, paying attention to the heart
      (kokoro) is considered to be a "serious custom".
    </p>
    <p>
      Technique characteristics of the Tamiya Style are that they are done in a
      large manner and precisely, paying attention to even the smallest of
      details. Furthermore, one must not forget to include "Nobility" and
      "Beauty". In this Style, what was termed "Tamiya Nobility" and "Tamiya
      Beauty" in the Edo Period is regarded to be of the utmost importance,
      along with the other point mentioned. In written tradition, there is the
      following statement:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      To begin with, this Style&#39;s instruction, using the principle of
      natural spontaneity, seeks to have proper intuition within and correctness
      of body without, which leads to the harmony of body and energy.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This harmony is the primary justification for training and allows one to
      decide the outcome in a matter of minutes by means of drawing one's sword.
