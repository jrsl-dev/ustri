  <h3>Celebrating 30 Years of Tradition</h3>

      Swordsmanship/Shakunage Japanese Culture Center

  <p>
    Like a solitary sentinel protecting an invaluable treasure, the Michigan
    Headquarters Dojo of the Tamiya School of Classical Japanese Swordsmanship
    (Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Michigan Honbu Dojo)/Shakunage Japanese Culture Center
    stands at one end of the traditional Japanese garden behind the home of
    DIanne and Michael Alexanian in the sleepy Glencairn neighborhood of East
    Lansing, Michigan.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the last 30 years, over 250 men and women from the United States,
    Europe, Russia and Asia have come to this Dojo to study the techniques and
    philosophy of this 429 year-old martial art founded by Tamiya Heibei
    Narimasa in the early 17th century and passed down, through a succession of
    Headmasters (Soke), to the present day leadership of 15th Generation Soke
    Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa.
  </p>

  <p>
    In March of 1996, Michael Alexanian (Gennan Buhaku) received a written
    commission from 14th Generation Soke Tsumaki Seirin Genshin to bring this
    classical Japanese martial art to America for the first time in the school’s
    400 year history.

  <p>
    To that end, Michael Gennan Sensei and his wife, Dianne Genan Sensei, began
    the process of building the first United States Dojo for Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu
    and the greater Lansing area’s first Japanese Cultural Center at their home
    in the midst of a tranquil Japanese garden complete with a raked gravel
    meditation garden behind the Dojo.

    With construction complete, on a warm and sunny September 20, 1996 various
    dignitaries including the Consul General of Japan, the Mayor of East
    Lansing, the Deputy Mayor of Lansing and the Assistant Headmaster of Tamiya
    Ryu Iaijutsu, along with other prominent community leaders and citizens
    gathered in front of the traditional Japanese gate (Tori) to officially
    dedicate and open the Dojo/Culture Center.

  <p>
    Assistant Headmaster Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa cut the ribbon stretched across the
    Torii and gave the first demonstration of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu in the new
    Dojo. There were also demonstrations of Shakuhachi (bamboo flute), how to
    properly dress in Kimono, and other aspects of traditional Japanese culture.

  <p>
    From that day forward and for the past 30 years, the United States Tamiya
    Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai has worked diligently and with a sense of true
    purpose to pass on this important element of classical Japanese culture to
    both young and old alike and to help realize the late 14th Generation Soke’s
    dream of making Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu available for study not only in Japan,
    but also internationally.
  </p>

  <p>
    To celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the founding of American Tamiya Ryu
    Iaijutsu, an Enbukai (Demonstration Event) will be held on September 20,
    2026, at the East Lansing Hannah Community Center East Gym from 1-3pm. This
    event is free and open to the general public and will feature Enbu (formal
    demonstrations) by 15th Generation Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa, the Senior
    Teaching Staff, the Head Instructor and the members of the Gennankai. We
    will be inviting the current Consul General of Japan, the Mayors of Lansing
    and East Lansing and the Visiting Official from Michigan’s Sister State of
    Shiga Prefecture to attend and say a few words to commemorate the occasion
    just as they did 30 years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    We cordially invite you to attend this special event and experience a truly
    unique aspect of traditional Japanese culture not often seen by the general
    public.

  <h2>Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu</h2>

  <div>
    <h3>Tamiya Ryu</h3>

    <aside>田宮流</aside>

    <p>
      Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu is a military art (bugei) that was introduced in the
      Tensho period (1573-1591) by its founder, Tamiya Heibei Narimasa.
      Narimasa, together with Katayama Hoki no kami Hisayasu (the founder of
      Hoki Ryu) and Sekiguchi Jushin (the founder of Sekiguchi Ryu) were pupiles
      of Hayashizake Jinsuke Shigenobu, the founder of iaijutsu.
    </p>

    <p>
      The style characteristics of the Tamiya school of swordsmenship are: First
      volume (Omote no maki) containing evelen kata and Second volume (Koran no
      maki) containing fourteen kata.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Iaijutsu</h3>

    <aside>居合術</aside>

    <p>
      Iaijutsu is a martial art (bujutsu) that strives to supress a sudden
      attack by the attacker against the defender using a single, swift stroke
      of the sword and seeks to master the various principles of drawing,
      re-sheathing and using the sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, iaijutsu is a martial way (budo) as it practiced with a
      humble and modest heart and continually trains the spirit.
    </p>
  </div>
