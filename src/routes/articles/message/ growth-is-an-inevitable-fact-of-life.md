Growth is an inevitable fact of life…

As the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Organization (USTRIO) approaches its 10th Anniversary on September 22 of this year, I find myself looking both backwards and forwards…all the while reflecting on the growth and changes that have occurred during the course of this time. As I look back, it seems like only yesterday that Fuku Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei visited Michigan for the first time on September 22, 1996, to dedicate the Dojo and Gardens and conduct his first classes for the Michigan students (Deshi) who, at that time, numbered around 11.

Looking at the present and into the future, we have been most fortunate over the past 10 years to experience a steady pattern of growth in our Dojo membership, adding between 3-5 new Deshi each year, so that today our total number of actively practicing Deshi is fast approaching 50.

Our greatest hope for the future is that this even pace of growth will continue into 2007 and beyond, and that we will continue to attract those who are serious about, and committed to their study of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. For while Deshi come and Deshi go, it is to those who not only view their training in Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu as a life-long pursuit, but also have deeply dedicated themselves, despite all odds, to the continuance of this Intangible Cultural Property, that we look in order to keep the Organization alive and growing.

In conclusion, as the USTRIO prepares to begin a new academic year on September 9, we would like to ask that all of our Deshi make a strong and serious commitment to their training and study of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu and to ask themselves one simple question: What am I doing/can I do to contribute to the growth of the USTRIO?
