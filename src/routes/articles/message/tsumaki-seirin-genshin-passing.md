It is with a deep sense of sadness and loss that we must report the passing of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu 14th Soke (Headmaster) Tsumaki Seirin Genshin. He passed away quietly at his home in Odawara Japan on Monday, June 4 at 6:32 AM and his Sogi (funeral service) was held on Saturday, June 9 at 1:00 PM, Japan time.

Soke Sensei spent a full life of 102 years and 3 months devoted to the study of Iai. Some of the significant events during his lifetime were his participation on the first review board of the All Japan Kendo Federation to determine the Kata that make up the Seitei Gata system; the publication of numerous books on Shigin (Japanese poems set to traditional Chinese meter) as well as the publication of his seminal text on Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu entitled: Shokai Tamiya Ryu Iai, or A Detailed Introduction to Tamiya Ryu Iai.

Another achievement during his career in Tamiya Ryu Iai was the realization of his lifelong dream to see Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu expand internationally, with formal Shibu, or Branches, now in existence in South Korea and North America; a dream that all of us affiliated with the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu organization have dedicated our lives to for the last 11 years, and will continue to dedicate ourselves to for many, many years to come.

As we all mourn the passing of Soke Sensei, and with the 2nd Japan-America Tamiya Ryu Taikai fast approaching, Fuku Soke (Assistant Headmaster) Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei has determined that this Taikai will still be held, but will now become a Memorial Taikai to his late father. There was some concern at first as to whether the Taikai would proceed as planned but, as Fuku Soke stated in one of his correspondences to the Michigan Honbu Dojo, to keep the 2007 Taikai on track would be what Soke Sensei himself would have wanted, as the international growth of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu was his personal dream.

Please join us in offering your thoughts, prayers and incense for the repose of Soke Senseiâ€™s soul.
