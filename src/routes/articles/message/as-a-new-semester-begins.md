With the summer of 2005 nearly at an end, and the beginning of a new semester at the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Michigan Honbu Dojo fast approaching, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to all those who helped to make this summer’s visit from Fuku Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei and Endo Tsuyako Gentei Sensei such an overwhelming success.

As Americans, we are taught from a young age to be individuals, and to put our own needs before those of any group to which we belong. What I saw this summer, however, was something quite the opposite. I watched with great pride and a sense of great joy as the Deshi of the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Organization functioned as a tightly knit, cohesive group, whether it was during a training session or in a social setting, always remembering that: “the needs of the many outweigh those of the few…or the one.” Everyone continually supported each other both inside and outside of the Dojo environment and pulled together when tasks needed to be done with no grumbling or complaining. We all worked toward a common goal as a group…not as individuals, and for that, I am extremely appreciative, as are Fuku Soke and Endo Sensei.

Let us all keep this sense of unity and supportiveness at the forefront of our thinking as we embark on our path of training once again!
