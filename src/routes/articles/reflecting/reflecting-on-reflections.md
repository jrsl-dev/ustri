For the past 25 years, this particular column of our website has been devoted to articles of an introspective and contemplative nature as reflected in the practice of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu in particular, and the traditional Japanese martial arts in general. Initially, this column was written by the Head Instructor as a vehicle to expand on the deeper nature of certain topics discussed during training but for which there was limited time during a given class to do so. It has been my great pleasure to oversee this column since it’s inception in 1996, but the time has now come for me to “pass the baton” to those with fresh and unique perspectives.

To that end, beginning in January of 2022 the six members of the Gennankai Instructional Staff will take turns submitting articles for this column on a monthly basis in an effort to rejuvenate this column which, I must admit, I have allowed to fall into a state of inactivity due to various life circumstances for some time now. I am very confident that our six Instructors will breathe new life into this section of our website and give it the attention that it properly deserves.

In closing, I would like to encourage all of our readers to make a point of checking our site on a regular basis to read and enjoy the new and improved Reflecting Pool and Message from the Head Instructor columns. I am confident that the fresh perspectives you will find there will reflect the minds and hearts of those who have been charged to carry the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai into the next quarter century... and beyond.

Respectfully submitted,

Michael Alexanian (Gennan Buhaku) 8th Dan<br>
President<br>
United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai
