  <h2>Training Information</h2>

  <p>
    Iaijustu is are techniques of drawing and cutting with the Japanese sword,
    or katana. Tamiya Ryu is a specific school of iaijutsu which is described as
    both a Martial Art (bujutsu) and a Martial Way (budo).
  </p>

  <p>
    Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu is distinguished by its emphasis on practicing basic
    techniques (Kihon). In other words, to properly learn kata means studying in
    great detail: 1) how to cut using the scabbard opening (Saya-guchi) and 2)
    how to use the scabbard hand (Saya-te). As a serious course of study,
    learning Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu involves having a clear understanding of the
    laws known as “Tamiya Nobility and Tamiya Purity.”
  </p>

  <p>Practice is conducted in a non-competitive environment.</p>

  <h3>Kata</h3>

  <p>
    As a koryu (a school established before the Meiji Restoration) the primary
    mode of training is kata. Kata are prearranged forms of practice design to
    instill the princles of the art into the student through repeated pratice.
    Iaijutsu kata are performed solo and usually consist of three phases:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Nukitsuke - The initial sword draw</li>
    <li>Kiritsuke - A follow up strike</li>
    <li>Noutou - Resheathing the blade</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The techniques of Tamiya Ryu are taught in two volumes. The kata are
    followed by a third volume of paired techniques only taught once the student
    has completed their initial study of the solo kata.

    Besides kata, basics are drilled as a group to warm up at the start of
    practice and paired exercises are practiced with bokuto (wooden swords) to
    study timing and distance (ma'ai).

  <h3>Equipment</h3>

  <p>
    The equipment used depends on the experience level of the particular
    student.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students new to our organization are simply required to wear clothing that
    will allow them to move around with ease. Loaner bokuto (wooden sword) and
    obi (belt) will be provided when first starting out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ungraded students that have become deshi wear a standard Karate/Judo style
    gi and will be begin using iaito (an alloy based sword that is unable to
    hold an edge).
  </p>

  <p>
    Graded students wear white iai style uwagi (a short sleeve top) with kaku
    obi and black hakama (pleated trouser). Instructors will typically wear the
    same as graded students but with a black uwagi, unless it is a formal
    occasion.
  </p>

  <p>
    In all cases, knee pads are <strong>highly recommended</strong>. Blades that
    have an edge or might be able to hold an edge are never allowed during
    class.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>All</strong> equipment must be inspected by the instructor before being
    used by a student in class.
