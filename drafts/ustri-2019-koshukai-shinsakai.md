The United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Koshu-Shinsakai was held at the Hannah Community Center in East Lansing, Michigan on Saturday July 20th, 2019. Congratulations to all that tested and passed their examination. Everyone did a wonderful job and we were impressed by everyone's progress over the year!

This year the MVP (most valuble performance, i.e. enbu) was awarded to Dan Mordan (Genzan) sensei and three of our long time assistant instructors, Joe Smith (Genko), James Russell (Gennetsu), and Daniel Wung (Genkou) were officially licensed as instructors under the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gennankai.
