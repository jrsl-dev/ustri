The Executives of the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Gengo Hojisha no Kai are pleased to announce the following Promotions/Honors that were achieved during the recent visit by 15th Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa and his Assistant, Endo Tsuyako Gentei Sensei. Everyone performed beyond our expectations and made not only the visiting Sensei proud but made our hearts swell to almost bursting.

Special Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai names (Gengo) were also awarded to our 3 new Godan members, as well as the honorific title "Kouga" to Dianne Genan Sensei. In a very surprising turn of events, Michael Alexanian Gennan Buhaku Sensei was elevated to the rank of Hachidan.

Soke Sensei also announced to our group the formation of the new USTRI Gengo Hojisha no Kai, with Gennan Buhaku Sensei to serve as the Kaicho (President) and Genan Sensei as the Fuku-kaicho (Vice President). This is truly a unifying step for both the Michigan Honbu Dojo and the Southeast Michigan Shibu as there are now 4 persons in each Branch that possess Gengo and can provide an equal presence and voice for Board Meetings, etc.

This year’s visit by the Sensei was a truly memorable one, and much was revived and renewed during their time here. Commitments were solidified, new pledges were made and long-term assignment were given, all to the delight of Soke Sensei and Endo Sensei and all who were involved to make this event truly "one for the books".
