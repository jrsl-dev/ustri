practicality

"Is this really practical?" This question often comes up from iai from students, particularly those that are still building up their fundamentals. This is an entirely reasonable question to ask and, often times, a question that is easy to dismiss by those more experienced in the practice of iai. Like many things, I think it's more interesting to engage with the question and explore what is prompting the question in the first place, then draw some conclusions.

The short answer is, yes.

The more interesting answer, begins with a second question; "Practical for what?"

If the question is whether Iaijutsu is practical for armored combat on the battlefield; no. It is not. By the time swords were drawn on the battlefield, if it came down to quick drawing techniques, it was probably too late.

The school that eventually became to be known as Tamiya Ryu, originated with Tamiya Heibei Narimasa, but it took three generations for what Nariama was teaching to become known as Tamiya Ryu. Today we refer to this early form of Tamiya Ryu, Kou Tamiya Ryu (literally, Old Tamiya Ryu). While this line of Tamiya Ryu did not make it to modern times, these techniques would have been similar to Shin Muso Hayashizaki Ryu Iaijutsu, an art that does exist to this day.

It is hear that I must offer the disclaimer that have no instruction in Shin Muso Hayashizaki Ryu. I've only watching various enbu performed by various members of that school over the years. I've always been struck by how _impractical_ it seems. The techniques as demonstrated match shutachi, using an odachi, and uchitachi, using a kodachi. Sutachi will often times move directly in from of uchitachi, place the hilt of their odachi in the face/on the shoulder of uchitachi and the kata will then begin.

The whole point of this "original" Iaijutsu, and perhaps this was part of the inspired vision of Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu, was that shutachi is deliberately putting themselves in a difficult position to draw their sword from. Uchidachi is well within shutachi's maai and for all intents and purposes, Uchidachi should have the advantage. It is from this "impractical" position that Shutachi must learn how to deploy the odachi from within the saya and gain victory over uchidachi.

Was this original form of Iaijutsu practical? No; And also, yes.
